3.1 Immutable object is an object which can't be changed after it's been created. For Python language the perfect example is a frozenset. 
3.2 Sequences offered by Python: lists, strings, tuples and sets and examples for them respectively. [1,2,3,4,5], '12345', (1,2,3,4,5), {1,2,3,4,5}
3.3 'is' checks if two variables refer to the same object. '==' checks for equality. The difference between them is tha 'is' can check only between two variables.
